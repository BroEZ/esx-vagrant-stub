#### vSphere Vagrant stub with provisioning examples

This stub has the Vagrantfile referenced in the article [Vagrant + vSphere + CentOS 7](http://blog.broez.com/vagrant-vsphere-centos-7/), with the addition of example calls and directory structures for Shell, Puppet, and Chef provisioning.  

It's not terribly useful (or sane) by itself, but it's a good starting place for vagrant projects running against vSphere.
